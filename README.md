# 🌐 NetPath Illuminator – The Network Odyssey

> 🚀 *Selected for the Cisco VIP 2025 Program - Industry Networking Project Challenge*

Welcome to the NetPath Illuminator project — a level-based, gamified simulation that visualizes the journey of network packets across complex topologies using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. This project was developed as part of the **VIP 2025 Cisco Networking Industry Problem Statement**, where I was **officially selected to participate** and contribute innovative solutions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To simulate the progressive learning path of network communication from basic connectivity to complex routing and security mechanisms — implemented in **8 levels** using Packet Tracer.

## 🧠 Levels Explained

### 🔹 Level 1 – PC to PC Communication

* **Goal:** Establish direct ping communication between two PCs.
* **Skills:** IP addressing, subnetting, basic topology.
* **Tools:** PC, Switch, Straight-through cables.

### 🔹 Level 2 – Static Routing

* **Goal:** Manually configure routes between 3 routers.
* **Skills:** IP tables, subnet division, `ip route` command.
* **Routing Protocol:** Static
* **Devices:** 3 Routers, 3 Switches, 6 PCs.

### 🔹 Level 3 – Dynamic Routing with RIP

* **Goal:** Automate route discovery using RIP v2.
* **Skills:** Dynamic routing configuration.
* **Command:** `router rip`, `network`, `version 2`.

### 🔹 Level 4 – OSPF Routing

* **Goal:** Implement OSPF across multi-router topology.
* **Skills:** Area 0 setup, advanced routing logic.
* **Command:** `router ospf 1`, `network`, `area`.

### 🔹 Level 5 – VLAN Configuration

* **Goal:** Create isolated networks in a LAN using VLANs.
* **Skills:** VLAN creation, port assignment, inter-switch trunking.

### 🔹 Level 6 – Inter-VLAN Routing

* **Goal:** Allow communication between different VLANs.
* **Skills:** Router-on-a-stick configuration, Sub-interfaces.

### 🔹 Level 7 – Access Control List (ACL) and NAT

* **Goal:** Restrict traffic and allow private-public IP mapping.
* **Skills:** Standard/Extended ACLs, NAT configuration.
* **Security Logic:** Deny/Permit policies, `access-list`, `nat inside/outside`.

### 🔹 Level 8 – End-to-End Traceroute + Final Output

* **Goal:** Simulate full-scale routing across all levels with traceroute verification.
* **Skills:** Debugging with `tracert`, ICMP flow visualization, path validation.
